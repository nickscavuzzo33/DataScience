1. Setup

1.1 Clone the Repository
First, clone the ocean.py repository:

git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py.git
cd ocean.py
1.2 Install the Package
Install the ocean.py package:

pip install ocean-lib
2. Remote Setup
Follow the instructions in the setup-remote.md to set up a remote environment. This involves:

2.1 Setting up Environment Variables
You'll need to set up several environment variables, including:

INFURA_PROJECT_ID: Your Infura project ID.
OCEAN_NETWORK_URL: The URL of the Ocean network you're connecting to.
FACTORY_DEPLOY_BLOCK: The block number when the factory was deployed.
METADATA_CONTRACT_BLOCK: The block number when the metadata contract was deployed.
2.2 Using the Barge
The Barge is a tool provided by Ocean Protocol to run a local Ocean network. If you're using the Barge, you'll need to set up additional environment variables.

3. Consume Flow
3.1 Initialize Ocean
Before you can consume data, you need to initialize the Ocean instance:

from ocean_lib.ocean.ocean import Ocean
from ocean_lib.config import Config

config = Config('path_to_config.ini')
ocean = Ocean(config)
3.2 Search for Data
Search for datasets on the Ocean marketplace:


search_results = ocean.assets.search('your_search_query')
3.3 Select a Dataset
From the search results, select a dataset you want to consume:


dataset = search_results[0]
3.4 Consume the Data
To consume the data, you'll need to purchase it first:

order_requirements = ocean.assets.order(dataset.did, 'access')
service_agreement_id = ocean.assets.pay_for_service(order_requirements, dataset)
Once the payment is successful, you can consume the data:


consumer = ocean.assets.download(
    dataset.did,
    service_agreement_id,
    order_requirements,
    'path_to_save_data'
)
4. Handle Errors and Exceptions
Ensure you handle any errors or exceptions that might occur during the consume flow. This includes checking if you have enough Ocean tokens to purchase the data, if the dataset is still available, and if there are any network issues.

5. Cleanup and Shutdown
After consuming the data, ensure you close any open connections and clean up any temporary files or resources.
