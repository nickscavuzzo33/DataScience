**Introduction the Ocean Protocol Python Library
**

**Purpose**:
Ocean.py is a Python library used to interact with Ocean Protocol, whether dealing with digital assets, datasets, or compute tasks. It provides functionalities to interact with the Ocean Protocol's smart contracts, assets, and compute services. Specifically:

1) Publishing and Consuming Ocean Assets: This module allows users to create, discover, and resolve assets on the Ocean Protocol.

2) Ocean Compute: This module provides functionalities related to compute services, such as starting and stopping compute jobs, or using compute-to-data (C2D).


**Benefits**: 
Asset Management: The library offers functionalities to create, discover, and resolve assets inside Ocean Protocol. This means developers can easily manage and work with digital assets without having to deal with the underlying complexities.

1) Compute Services: With Ocean Compute (C2D), developers can start and stop compute jobs, allowing for seamless integration of compute tasks with Ocean Protocol.

2) Smart Contract Interaction: ocean.py facilitates interaction with Ocean Protocol smart contracts. This means developers can execute, manage, and monitor smart contract operations directly from their Python applications.

3) Pythonic Approach: Being a Python library, ocean.py allows developers familiar with Python to easily integrate and work with Ocean Protocol without the need to learn a new language or framework.

4) Extensibility: The modular design of the library means that developers can easily extend and customize its functionalities to suit their specific needs.

5) Community Support: Being a part of the Ocean Protocol ecosystem, ocean.py benefits from the support and contributions of the broader community, ensuring continuous improvements and updates.
